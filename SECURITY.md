## What we do

We follow GSA's [IT security policy](https://www.gsa.gov/directive/gsa-information-technology-%28it%29-security-policy) to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of USWDS.

We use [Snyk](https://snyk.io) to find, fix, and prevent vulnerabilities in USWDS dependencies. We run Snyk checks locally during development and automatically on all pull requests.

We perform static analysis on our JavaScript on every pull requests with [GitHub CodeQL](https://securitylab.github.com/tools/codeql).

We include a security and vulnerability report with every USWDS release, and release security patches for both the 1.x and 2.x branches.

## What you can do

We encourage you to verify the security and status of the USWDS package:

1. **Check the vulnerability badge.** Confirm the vulnerability badge in the
   [USWDS Github code repository](https://github.com/uswds/uswds) says there are
   `0` vulnerabilities.
1. **Download the package via NPM.** We recommend using the [NPM package](https://designsystem.digital.gov/documentation/developers/#install-using-npm)
   instead of downloading the [zip file](https://designsystem.digital.gov/documentation/developers/#download).
   NPM ensures youâ€™re using a legitimate copy of USWDS straight from the source.
   It also makes it easier to stay up-to-date with the latest USWDS version.
