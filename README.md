# U.S. Federal Web Design Standards

[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/18F/usfwds.svg?branch=18f-pages-staging)](https://travis-ci.org/18F/usfwds)

This is the repo for the U.S. Federal Web Design Standards project.
The structural setup of this repo is based off of the 18F pages project: 
[https://github.com/18F/pages](https://github.com/18F/pages)

## Setup for your local environment

### Requirements

You will need [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org) ( > version 2.1.5 ). You may
consider using a Ruby version manager such as
[rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv) or [rvm](https://rvm.io/) to
help ensure that Ruby version upgrades don't mean all your
[gems](https://rubygems.org/) will need to be rebuilt.

On OS X, you can also use [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) to install Ruby in
`/usr/local/bin`, which may require you to update your `$PATH` environment
variable. Here are the commands to follow to install via homebrew:

```shell
$ brew update
$ brew install ruby
```

### Installation

Now that you have verified that you have Ruby installed, clone and run the 
following [go](https://golang.org/) commands to initialize and serve the library locally.

```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:18F/usfwds.git
$ cd usfwds
$ ./go init
$ ./go serve
```

You should now be able to visit `http://127.0.0.1:4000/usfwds/` 
and view the web design standards locally.
